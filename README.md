# pi5fresh
Personal Pi 5 setup script cause I'm lazy and don't want to visit every bookmark after a fresh install.

**Will remove LibreOffice and Thunderbird if they are installed.**

Works with Ubuntu & PiOS.
Depending on OS version, not adding OBS and Retroarch repos means you may not get the latest versions of those two apps.

Installs SDL2 environment and ffmpeg, Gimp, Krita, the two apps mentioned above, VLC and Botspots' Pi-Apps before cloning into and building the FBNeo Libretro core.
